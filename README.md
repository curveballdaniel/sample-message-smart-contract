# sample-message-smart-contract

A simple dApp built on Ethereum in Solidity that allows the user to write a message, save it in the smart contract, and access it at any time. No one other than the user address can see the message he has uploaded, and no one other than the user can change the message uploaded. 

This includes some frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to tie things together and make a user workable smart contract. 

This page does require MetaMask in order to properly communicate with the contract.

As of right now, the contract runs solely on Ropsten. It will probably be migrated to mainnet at some point.
